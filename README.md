# Bayesian-Environmental-Modeling-Course-exercises
R-scripts generated from 2017 Bayesian Environmental Modeling course at UFZ in Leipzig to be shared with students and instructors

There are 6 files: two each on sensitivity analyses (Sobol's and Morris elementary effects), on basics of Bayesian inference (Bayesian inference and Bayesian least squares), and on numerics for Bayesian methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and optimization). These refer to exercises from the day 1, 2, and 3 of the course respectively. Several input files (.dat or .txt) are included.
