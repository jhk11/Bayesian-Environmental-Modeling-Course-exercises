# Bayesian-Environmental-Modeling-Course-exercises
R-scripts generated from 2017 Bayesian Environmental Modeling course at UFZ in Leipzig

There are 6 files: two each on sensitivity analyses (Sobol's and Morris elementary effects), on basics of Bayesian inference (Bayesian inference and Bayesian least squares), and on numerics for Bayesian methods (Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations and optimization). These refer to exercises from day 1,2,3 of the course respectively.
